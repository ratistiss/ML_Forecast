Machine Learning model that uses multiple linear regression to predict the daily Hi temperature on Mars. This Model was built and trained in Jupyter Notebook using weather records from the Curiosity Rover, then put in a Pikl file which is used by Flask to take incoming data and make the prediction. Currently in use on https://www.The-Weatherman-Mars.com.
